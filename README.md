# Personal-Portfolio
Portfolio created using React

## Description
This application is an updated portfolio site built using React. The site has a header (including Nav bar) and footer element that persist pages and four page components: present (home), projects (project gallery), past (about), and contact.

The site uses Bootstrap to build a mobile-first design, with media compatability on larger screens.

## Usage

Users can navigate through the site using the navbar in the header element: 
- The Home page has a basic layout with information and two images. 
- The Project page shows the user images of six projects, the user can click on the image and further content is shown including the: title, description and links to the deployed site and gitHub pages.
- The Past page includes a vertical timeline working from present to past where users can scroll to see my personal journey including employment and education.
- The Contact page has three key elements: a contact form built using emailjs. The user can enter their name, email, subject and message and send me an email directly - if any of the inputs are left blank, an error message will appear. Links to mailto my email from their own email application, and links to GitHub and LinkedIn. And finally a PDF viewer to view a recent version of my CV - users are able to zoom and move the document using the viewer provided by React.

## Credits 
This application was written by me, personalising exerpts of code provided by EdX examples from the 16-week Front-End Development bootcamp. The contact form was created using emailjs and a guide article written by Medium.com. The vertical timeline element has been edited from code created by stephane-monnot.github.io/. 

## Notes 
There are a number of improvements I still want to make to the site, including: 
- add validation for email address characters in the ContactForm component
- update the footer element to be interactive
- work on the styling of the ProjectCard elements.
